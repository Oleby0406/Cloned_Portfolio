                        <p> Maaaaaario was a fun project which had the
                        purpose of learning the purpose of variables
                        and functions with information we understand,
                        without using html, css, JS or such. We also had
                        to work in groups that we did not pick. My
                        teammates, Juan and Ayush all did equal work and
                        did not necessarily asign roles, but a big
                        contribution I made was the jumping script that
                        makes up the platformer. We often had code that did
                        not work as intented, and that was the greatest 
                        challenge we had. In those cases we often consulted
                        each either and ended up either fixing the problem, 
                        or finding a way to change the game to get around it.
                        Through teamwork and constructive criticism, we made 
                        a game that some called Mario levels worthy.</p>
